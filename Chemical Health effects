Data on the toxicities of various chemicals was availabe from kaggle database. Each chemical is categories into toxic category as recognized and suspected. Additionally toxicity towards various body alinments were also given. for e.g, toxicity towards blood, kidneys , cancer etc are given. The goal of the project would be to develop a classifcation  model to evaluate a consumer product/material on toxicity towards various health. Every consumer product would have some chemicals and each chemical would have toxicity towards different health. The chemicals in teh consumer product will be compared with the database and give visual insights on the toxicity plots. Addtionally machine learning algorithm will be used to develop a score card on the health effects of the consumer product.

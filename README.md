## 2.  Cuff less blood pressure measurement:  The main goal of this data set is providing clean and valid signals for designing cuff-less blood pressure estimation algorithms. The raw electrocardiogram (ECG), photoplethysmograph (PPG), and arterial blood pressure (ABP) signals are originally collected from the physionet.org and then some preprocessing and validation performed on them. The data set from kaggle is below:

## 3. Chemical health effects and toxicities: Chemicals have health effects: some recognized and some suspected. A comprehensive list of those chemicals and their health effects would be beneficial to those wishing to associate those chemicals' health effects with other sets of data. The datasets uploaded here represent the "blending" of various individual chemical health effect datasets as compiled by Scorecard and hosted by the GoodGuideweb site.
